Wrote my first program in 2010 in BASIC. As a 13 year old kid, cracked around 20 neighboring WiFi connections with the legendary Alfa router and Backtrack 5r3, which is commonly known now as Kali Linux. At 15, I was already running Counter-Strike community servers on my workstation, customizing plugins and taking the gamers' experience to a whole new level.

Fast forward to today, I'm a proud founder of a cutting-edge tech startup specializing in Full Stack Development, DevOps, and Cloud Solutions Architecture. With a passion for innovation and a strong background in the tech industry, I established Tech Supersonic LLC to address the evolving needs of businesses in today's digital landscape.
